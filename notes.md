Written
- Challenge can take you up to an hour, can finish it less than hour. Challenge is the bulk of the assessment
- Coding examples/definitions
- Reflect the medium 2 exercises
  - Should be able to do within the timeframe
- You don't have to bundle for the assessment
- Challenge problem for assessment is difficult in between easy/medium

*********
- Understand that methods and blocks can return chunks of code - closures - examples, why is it important?

Example from Allister
(Take with a grain of salt)

# A method or a block can return a closure. Blocks canâ€™t be returned, however `Proc`s (and lambdas) can be. This is useful because we can then call a `Proc` object that is returned by a method or block. 

# We can create multiple different `Proc`s from a method by calling the method multiple times. Each `Proc` will have its own private artifacts in its binding. So we can save the `Proc`s to different variables, and separately interact with each `Proc` and its unique artifacts.

```ruby
def return_proc
  name = 'al'
  count = 0
  Proc.new do
    count += 1
    puts name * count
  end
end

output_name = return_proc
output_name.call # al
output_name.call # alal
output_name.call # alalal

output_name_again = return_proc
output_name_again.call # al
```

**********

another example from Suk Sien
```ruby
def factorial(factor)
  # Proc remembers the value of factor at the moment of creation
  Proc.new {|n| (n..factor).inject(:*) }
end

factorial_to3 = factorial(3)
factorial_to7 = factorial(7)

factorial_to3.call(1) # => 6
factorial_to7.call(3) #=> 2520
```

### Testing

- Look at test cases first to see what objects will be instantiated, then look at the question

- Just need the class for the answer, not the PEDAC
- Splat operator cannot take a default parameter

- Be sure to run Rubocop
- Submit answer through normal assessment textbox

### Ruby Tools

- Stick to the general understanding
- What is a gemfile
  - Syntax
  - purpose
  - etc

### What is yield in Ruby and how do we use it?

- yield is a keyword used to execute a block passed into a method

```ruby
def some_method
  yield
end
```

### How do we check if a block is passed into a method?

```ruby
def some_method
  yield if block_given?
end
```

if method definition has a &, pass in a &. If not, do not pass one in.

# ### BLOCKS

# # 1, What are closures?

# # 2, What is binding?

# # 3, How does binding affect the scope of closures?

# # 4, How do blocks work?

# # 5, When do we use blocks? (List the two reasons)
# 1. Defer some implementation details during method invocation time. 
# def times
# 2. OUr code performinng before and after actions, i.e. sandwich code. 

# # 6, Describe the two reasons we use blocks, use examples.

# # 7, When can you pass a block to a method? Why?

# # 8, How do we make a block argument manditory?

# # 9, How do methods access both implicit and explicit blocks passed in?
# yield, access by variable name

# def test(&block)
#   puts "What's &block? #{block}" # block = nil
# end

# test

# def test2(block)
#   puts "hello"
#   block.call          # calls the block that was originally passed to test()
#   puts "good-bye"
# end

# def test(&block)
#   puts "1"
#   test2(block)
#   puts

# # 10, What is `yield` in Ruby and how does it work?

# # 11, How do we check if a block is passed into a method?

# # 12, Why is it important to know that methods and blocks can return closures?

# # def sequence
# #   counter = 0
# #   Proc.new { counter += 1 }
# # end

# # s1 = sequence
# # p s1.call # 1
# # p s1.call # 2
# # p s1.call # 3

# # s2 = sequence 
# # p s2.call # 1
# # p s1.call # 4
# # p s2.call # 2

# # 13, What are the benifits of explicit blocks?

# # 14, Describe the arity differences of blocks, procs, methods and lambdas.

# # 15, What other differences are there between lambdas and procs? (might not be assessed on this, but good to know)

# # 16, What does `&` do when in a the method parameter?

# # def method(&var)
# #   var.call
# #   yield
# # end

# # 17, What does `&` do when in a method invocation argument?

# # ```ruby
# # method(&var)
# # ```

# # 18, What is happening in the code below?

# # arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# # p arr.map(&:to_s) # specifically `&:to_s`

# # arr.map do |num|
# #   num.to_s
# # end

# # (&:to_s) # => { |num| num.to_s }

# # a_proc = :to_s.to_proc
# # p arr.map(&a_proc)

# # 19, How do we get the desired output without altering the method or the method invocations?


# # def call_this
# #   yield(2)
# # end

# # to_s = Proc.new { |n| n.to_i }
# # to_i = Proc.new { |n| n.to_s }

# # p call_this(&to_s) # => returns 2
# # p call_this(&to_i) # => returns "2"


# # 20, How do we invoke an explicit block passed into a method using `&`? Provide example.

# # 21, What concept does the following code demonstrate?

# # def time_it
# #   time_before = Time.now
# #   yield
# #   time_after= Time.now
# #   puts "It took #{time_after - time_before} seconds."
# # end

# 22, What will be outputted from the method invocation `block_method('turtle')` below? Why does/doesn't it raise an error?

def block_method(animal, animal2)
  yield(animal)
end

block_method('turtle', 'seal') do |turtle, seal|
  puts "This is a #{turtle} and a #{seal}."
end

# # 23, What will be outputted if we add the follow code to the code above? Why?

# # animal = 'seal'
# # block_method('turtle') { 
# #  
# #   puts "This is a #{animal}."}


# # 24, What will the method call `call_me` output? Why?

# # def call_me(some_code) # Proc
# #   some_code.call
# # end

# # name = "Robert"
# # chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
# # name = "Griffin"

# # call_me(chunk_of_code)


# # 25, What happens when we change the code as such:

# # ```ruby
# # def call_me(some_code)
# #   some_code.call
# # end

# # chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
# # name = "Griffin"

# # call_me(chunk_of_code)
# # ```

# # 26, What will the method call `call_me` output? Why?


# def call_me(some_code)
#   some_code.call
# end

# # def name
# #   "Joe"
# # end

# #name = "Robert"

# chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}

# # def name
# #   "Joe"
# # end

# call_me(chunk_of_code)

# def name
#   "Joe"
# end


# # 27, Why does the following raise an error?

# # ```ruby
# # def a_method(pro)
# #   pro.call
# # end

# # a = 'friend'
# # a_method(&a)
# # ```

# # 28, Why does the following code raise an error?

# # ```ruby
# # def some_method(block)
# #   block_given?
# # end

# # bl = { puts "hi" }

# # p some_method(bl)
# # ```

# # 29, Why does the following code output `false`?

# # ```ruby
# # def some_method(block)
# #   block_given?
# # end

# # bloc = proc { puts "hi" }

# # p some_method(bloc)
# # ```

# # 30, How do we fix the following code so the output is `true`? Explain

# # ```ruby
# # def some_method(block)
# #   block_given? # we want this to return `true`
# # end

# # bloc = proc { puts "hi" } # do not alter this code

# # p some_method(bloc)
# # ```

# # 31, How does `Kernel#block_given?` work?

# # 32, Why do we get a `LocalJumpError` when executing the below code? &
# # How do we fix it so the output is `hi`? (2 possible ways)

# # ```ruby
# # def some(block)
# #   yield
# # end

# # bloc = proc { p "hi" } # do not alter

# # some(bloc)
# # ```

# # 33, What does the following code tell us about lambda's? (probably not assessed on this but good to know)

# # ```ruby
# # bloc = lambda { p "hi" }

# # bloc.class # => Proc
# # bloc.lambda? # => true

# # new_lam = Lambda.new { p "hi, lambda!" } # => NameError: uninitialized constant Lambda
# # ```

# # 34, What does the following code tell us about explicitly returning from proc's and lambda's? (once again probably not assessed on this, but good to know ;)

# # ```ruby
# # def lambda_return
# #   puts "Before lambda call."
# #   lambda {return}.call
# #   puts "After lambda call."
# # end

# # def proc_return
# #   puts "Before proc call."
# #   proc {return}.call
# #   puts "After proc call."
# # end

# # lambda_return #=> "Before lambda call."
# #               #=> "After lambda call."

# # proc_return #=> "Before proc call."

# # ```

# # 35, What will `#p` output below? Why is this the case and what is this code demonstrating?

# # ```ruby
# # def retained_array
# #   arr = []
# #   Proc.new do |el|
# #     arr << el
# #     arr
# #   end
# # end

# # arr = retained_array
# # arr.call('one')
# # arr.call('two')
# # p arr.call('three')
# # ```

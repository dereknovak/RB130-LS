## Closures

"A closure is a general programming concept that allows programmers to save a "chunk of code" and execute it at a later time. It's called a "closure" because it's said to bind its surrounding artifacts (ie, names like variables and methods) and build an "enclosure" around everything so that they can be referenced when the closure is later executed."
